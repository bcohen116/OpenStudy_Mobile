# OpenStudy_Mobile
The mobile app (Android) for OpenStudy


Our database only has a 1 year free trial, so if that is down, see the screenshots in this folder to see what the app does.

This app will allow users to check the room status of library study rooms, check into a room, and receive notifications when a room becomes available.
